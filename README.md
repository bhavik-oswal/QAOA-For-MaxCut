# QAOA-For-MaxCut
This project explores the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through an experimental study of the MaxCut problem on small graph instances. Using PennyLane and a quantum simulator, we develop a modular QAOA implementation and benchmark its performance on a fixed set of representative graphs. The project includes detailed visualizations of graph structures, optimized cut partitions, sampled bitstring distributions, and the corresponding quantum circuits. Our results demonstrate how increasing circuit depth affects solution quality, providing a clear and reproducible illustration of QAOA behavior in combinatorial optimization and the relationship between circuit depth, graph structure, and algorithmic performance.
